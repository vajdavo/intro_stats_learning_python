Tian Yang, CEO of Variant Perception, approaches macroeconomic analysis through a structured framework encompassing three distinct horizons: tactical (spanning one week to one month), cyclical (covering six to twelve months), and structural (extending three to five years). Yang highlights recent market turbulence, particularly the simultaneous sharp declines in equities and gold, as indicative of severe market stress reminiscent of historic crises such as the COVID crash and Lehman Brothers collapse. Currently, markets appear to be signaling the need for emergency intervention from the Federal Reserve, though Chair Jerome Powell remains cautious, awaiting further market downturn before potentially implementing rate cuts. This dynamic has created a precarious “game of chicken” scenario between market participants and policymakers, raising the risk of forced liquidations and increased volatility.

Structurally, Yang expresses a bearish outlook for the U.S. dollar, grounded in the current U.S. administration’s aggressive stance on reducing bilateral trade deficits through tariffs. This represents a significant shift toward economic nationalism and a move away from globalized economic efficiency. He argues that such a strategic policy shift naturally supports a structurally weaker U.S. dollar, driven by anticipated declines in trade deficits and corresponding reductions in international demand for U.S. dollar-denominated assets. Consequently, countries not aligned closely with U.S. interests may increasingly diversify their reserve holdings toward alternative assets such as gold.

Regarding inflation, Yang observes a dual impact from tariffs. In the short term (cyclical horizon), tariffs cause economic disruption and uncertainty, acting as disinflationary pressures through reduced consumer and business confidence, leading to demand destruction. However, on a longer structural timeline, these policies create inherent inefficiencies and redundancies in global supply chains, fostering a persistently higher structural inflation environment. Yang emphasizes the risks inherent in recent policy sequencing, as tariffs and economic restructuring have been enacted without first adequately addressing existing inflationary pressures or fiscal deficits, potentially deepening the likelihood and severity of a recession.

In terms of investment strategy, Yang advises caution regarding equities in the near term, while identifying structural opportunities in domestically oriented U.S. manufacturing and infrastructure sectors, such as railways and materials. He favors Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) over nominal bonds, highlighting structural fiscal challenges that limit nominal bonds’ traditional role as risk-off assets. Yang maintains a bullish outlook on gold and real assets, viewing them as beneficiaries of anticipated U.S. dollar weakness and global uncertainty.

On the global stage, Yang categorizes China as structurally unfavorable (“red box”) under current U.S. policy perspectives. Geopolitical tensions and ongoing trade conflicts signal lasting shifts in global supply chains. Historical parallels suggest such sustained trade disruptions permanently alter international economic relationships, making Chinese equities, despite attractive valuations, difficult to navigate due to unpredictable geopolitical risks.

Yang employs tactical indicators, specifically Log-Periodic Power Law (LPPL) models, to detect patterns indicative of market exhaustion and potential turning points. Current market conditions exhibit signs consistent with impending capitulation phases, though fewer LPPL signals are currently active compared to previous significant downturns.

Drawing comparisons to policy-induced recessions during the Reagan era, Yang anticipates a similar short, sharp economic downturn potentially followed by stimulus-driven recovery. However, he cautions that the premature implementation of tariffs without prior stabilization of inflation and fiscal balances complicates the current economic scenario, potentially exacerbating economic disruption. Moving forward, market sensitivity remains elevated, closely tied to policy developments and international negotiations, notably potential tariff adjustments involving nations like Vietnam or Israel.

In conclusion, Tian Yang underscores the importance of cautious investment positioning amid short-term market risks and significant structural economic shifts. He recommends allocations favoring inflation protection through TIPS and gold, investments in domestically oriented U.S. sectors, and careful avoidance of assets disadvantaged by the evolving economic landscape, including nominal bonds and multinational firms highly reliant on China. Vigilant monitoring of policy responses and market dynamics will be crucial in navigating the current complex macroeconomic environment.
